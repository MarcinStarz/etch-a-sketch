# Etch-a-sketch project
It's my another project for learning purposes. You can pick a color, change canvas size and draw!

# LIVE DEMO:

# What I've learnt
- Styling HTMLInputElement
- I improved my DOM manipulation knowledge (operating with event listeners)

# What do I need to learn
- The difference between function expression and function declaration
- Writing more readable and cleaner code (as you always do)
